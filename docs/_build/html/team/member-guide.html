<h1>Team Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#team-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This page holds resources for members of the Jupyter Server team.
They’re meant to guide team members to be happy, productive members of the
team!</p>
<section id="what-are-the-team-resources">
<h2>What are the team resources?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-team-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a few resources that are particularly useful for team members. Here’s
a quick list to get you started.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass"><strong>The Jupyter Server Team Compass</strong></a>
is a repository with lots of information about team-related things. It has
development tips, information about team meetings, milestones and roadmaps,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues"><strong>The Jupyter Server Team Compass issues</strong></a>
are where we often discuss specific, actionable things related to the <em>team</em>
(e.g., discussing whether to change something in the team-compass repo).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/jupyter/jupyter_server"><strong>The Jupyter Server gitter channel</strong></a> is used to have synchronous conversation
for several projects. If a conversation will likely span multiple hours,
or is relevant to many people, consider opening a thread in Discourse or
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">team-compass</span></code> repository instead.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="general-policy-about-communication-channels">
<h3>General policy about communication channels<a class="headerlink" href="#general-policy-about-communication-channels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We are trying to organize our discussions in order to help both contributors and
maintainers find and choose the right communication channels and have a positive experience :-)</p>
<p>In this respect, we are using:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>GitHub issues for specific discussions related to changing a repository’s content
(e.g. feature requests, bug reports).</p></li>
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://discourse.jupyter.org/">Discourse forum</a> for general discussions, support
questions, or just as a place where we can inspire each other.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<section id="how-can-i-help">
<h2>How can I help?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-help" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a member of the team, you are encouraged to continue
helping in the same ways that you already have. Your contributions to
documentation, code, etc are always welcome.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that, as a member of the team, you’re representing the community
when you interact with people (online and offline). Try to keep a friendly, positive
attitude, and be welcoming and helpful in bringing others into the community
and answering their questions.</p>
<section id="are-there-any-specific-responsibilies">
<h3>Are there any specific responsibilies?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-there-any-specific-responsibilies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We don’t want team membership to
be a big burden (many of us have one or more other jobs too!) but there are
a few things that you should do as a new team member:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>“Watch” the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass">team compass repository</a></strong>
so that you’re notified when team conversations are happening.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semi-regularly attend team meetings</strong>. You can find a notes from previous meetings pinned at
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues">top of the team-compass issues page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commit at least 6 months to team membership</strong>. Training and mentoring new
team members is an investment by the existing team, hence team
membership requires commitment from both sides. Beyond 6 months, if active
team membership is no longer possible for you, you can always
join the green team!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Let us know if you’ll be unavailable</strong> or out of town for an extended period
of time. It’s no problem if you need to focus on other things for a bit, but it’s
helpful for the team to know who will be around.
To do so, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues/new">open an issue in the team-compass</a>.
If it’s something you’d rather not mention to the public then
send an email to one of the team members letting them know, and they
can communicate it to the others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foster open and inclusive discussion</strong>. As a team member, you are
responsible for ensuring that conversation in our communities is positive
and inclusive. Open public issues to discuss things with the team. Try to
do most communication in public spaces where others can join, or
report back to team members if important conversations happened offline.
When creating issues, provide enough context so that others can understand
and provide their input. Encourage feedback and input from others
often, and be patient when merging code - it is almost better to
wait a bit for an approve than to self-merge.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="when-should-i-merge-a-pull-request">
<h2>When should I merge a pull request?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-should-i-merge-a-pull-request" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a team member, you’re encouraged to help others contribute to the project
by reviewing their code, guiding them towards making a contribution and
improving it, and ultimately merging their contribution into the project.</p>
<p>Having merge rights is both a privilege and a responsibility - please be
thoughtful when using it! To that extent, here are a few guidelines when
deciding to merge things into one of our repositories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Use your best judgment</strong>. As a member of the Jupyter Server team, we trust
your judgment, and we ask you to use your best judgment in deciding when to
take an action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure it’s quality code</strong>. We know this is somewhat subjective, but
ensure that the code is well-organized and thoughtfully-written, that any
new features are documented, and that it abides by best-practices in Python,
JavaScript, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure there are tests</strong>. We try not to merge any new features (or
bugfixes!) without adding tests for them. It’s easy to consider something
minor-enough that it doesn’t warrant a test, but try to avoid doing this!
Adding tests usually only takes a moment, and our future selves will thank
us for it later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure there’s been enough time for discussion</strong>. We’re an open
community with an inclusive decision-making process. This means that
sometimes we need to slow down to make sure others have a chance to
review and provide their thoughts on changes. There’s no hard rule for
this, but try to make sure people have a chance to weigh in. Consider
pinging people that you think might be interested in a question, and
give it a few extra days before merging if you think a topic will be
complex enough to warrant discussion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t be afraid to merge!</strong> We know this is a bit counter-intuitive
given what we just said, but don’t be afraid to merge new code. If you
think a change is really complex or potentially controversial, give it
some time, but for most changes it is fine to just go ahead and merge.
Again, we trust your judgment, and we don’t want these guidelines to become
a burden that slows down development.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="adding-a-new-team-member">
<h2>Adding a new team member<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-new-team-member" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For someone to become a team member, they should already be a consistent,
positive, productive member of the community. Newcomers are encouraged to
become team members, after they’ve shown a sustained interest in
engaging with the community. Moreover, team members should be interested in
<strong>continuing their engagement</strong> over a long-ish period of time, generally
putting in more time and effort than non-team members. This doesn’t have to
mean contributing code - it can be assisting others in forums/issues, reviewing
pull requests, participating in team meetings, etc.</p>
<p>Any new team members must be “championed” by a pre-existing team member. This
is a person who recommends that the new person be invited to join the team.
This process takes the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The champion should first discuss internally with team members to get buy-
in and ensure that there’s general consensus before officially starting
the process.</p></li>
<li><p>If there seems to be team consensus,
the champion contacts the potential new team member and ask if they are
interested. Don’t forget to run them by the <a class="reference internal" href="governance.html#jupyter-server-team-responsibilities"><span class="std std-ref">Team responsibilities</span></a>
page to make sure they understand what they’re signing up for.
If so, then move to the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>The champion opens a new issue in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass%3E">team compass repository</a>.
The issue should state your support of the new team member, discuss why
you think they are great and why they should join the team.</p></li>
<li><p>This issue should stay open for around 10 days to give members of the team
a chance to weigh in their thoughts (and support!).</p></li>
<li><p>If there are no objections that haven’t been resolved, the new team member
is welcomed into the community as an official team member!</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="periodic-team-check-ins">
<h2>Periodic team check-ins<a class="headerlink" href="#periodic-team-check-ins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We want team membership to be an opportunity to grow and have an impact, not
a burden or a time sink. While we ask for a minimum 6 month commitment when
you join a Jupyter Server team, we don’t expect this commitment to
last forever.</p>
<p>We try to conduct regular “check-ins” for team members approximately once every 6 months.
The goal is to make sure that you’re happy in your current position with the Jupyter Server project,
and discuss whether you’d like to continue in your current role, transition to
a different role, or transition to the green team.</p>
<p>These check-ins happen via GitHub issues on the team compass repository,
here’s the issue text to use:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">Title: Team check-in for Zsailer</span>
<span class="go">Body:</span>

<span class="go">Hello &lt;username&gt;, this is a [team check-in](&lt;link to this docs page&gt;) for your Jupyter Server team status.</span>
<span class="go">Please respond below if you&#39;re interested in either:</span>

<span class="go">* Continuing in your current role</span>
<span class="go">* Moving to a new role</span>
<span class="go">* Moving to the green team</span>

<span class="go">There&#39;s no pressure one way or another, this is just to check that you&#39;re still</span>
<span class="go">comfortable with the role and responsibilities for your current position.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There’s no pressure or expectation associated with these check-ins, their goal
is to make sure that team members have an opportunity to voice their perspective
and choose their next steps within the community.</p>
<section id="if-a-team-member-doesn-t-respond-to-a-check-in">
<h3>If a team member doesn’t respond to a check-in<a class="headerlink" href="#if-a-team-member-doesn-t-respond-to-a-check-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes team members aren’t able to respond to check-ins. This is no problem -
other duties, life, vacation, etc often get in the way. In this case,
we’ll try to reach out with the following steps.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, we’ll ping team members in their check-in issue to maximize likelihood of notifications</p></li>
<li><p>After 7 days, we’ll ping the issue again with a “maybe you missed this” comment</p></li>
<li><p>After 14 days, we’ll send an email</p></li>
<li><p>After 21 days, we’ll send a follow-up email to double-check your availability.</p></li>
<li><p>After 30 days if you haven’t responded, we’ll move you to the green team</p></li>
<li><p>You can move back into another team whenever you like - just reach out and we’ll revert the change.</p></li>
