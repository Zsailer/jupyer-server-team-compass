Adding a new team member
=========================

For someone to become a team member, they should already be a consistent,
positive, productive member of the community. Newcomers are encouraged to
become team members, after they've shown a sustained interest in
engaging with the community. Moreover, team members should be interested in
**continuing their engagement** over a long-ish period of time, generally
putting in more time and effort than non-team members. This doesn't have to
mean contributing code - it can be assisting others in forums/issues, reviewing
pull requests, participating in team meetings, etc.

Any new team members must be "championed" by a pre-existing team member. This
is a person who recommends that the new person be invited to join the team.
This process takes the following steps:

1. The champion should first discuss internally with team members to get buy-
   in and ensure that there's general consensus before officially starting
   the process.
2. If there seems to be team consensus,
   the champion contacts the potential new team member and ask if they are
   interested. Don't forget to run them by the :ref:`binder-team-responsibilities`
   page to make sure they understand what they're signing up for.
   If so, then move to the next step.
3. The champion opens a new issue in the `team compass repository <https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass>`_.
   The issue should state your support of the new team member, discuss why
   you think they are great and why they should join the team.
4. This issue should stay open for around 10 days to give members of the team
   a chance to weigh in their thoughts (and support!).
5. If there are no objections that haven't been resolved, the new team member
   is welcomed into the community as an official team member!
6. Finally, make sure to follow the steps in :ref:`onboarding`.
